# Colony-Counting-of-Listeria-monocytogenes-on-ALOA-Plates


This project focuses on automating the counting of *Listeria monocytogenes* colonies on ALOA (Agar Listeria according to Ottaviani and Agosti) plates, which are commonly used for detecting and differentiating *Listeria* species. The goal is to develop a deep learning model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately detect and count bacterial colonies. The dataset includes high-quality images of ALOA plates with corresponding labels indicating colony locations, which were used to train the model. 

The CNN was trained using Python with libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. The provided code enables model training and evaluation using labeled images. 

Additionally, a Streamlit web application has been developed to host the trained model, allowing users to upload images of ALOA plates and receive colony counts in real-time. This tool simplifies the counting process, reducing human error and time for microbiological analysis.
